# Portfolio
This is Day 2 Challenge
# Description
What was my motivation?
My motivation was to make a website to learn more about html and css. I struggled to learn them, which has helped me better understand what they are. I still want to learn more and improve my website, but I must keep moving now.
Why did you build this project?
I built it because I want to learn more about building a website. I like the idea of making my own website and doing whatever I want. I want to show off my skills and what I learned from the book camp and hopefully get hired.
What problems does it solve?
One of the problems it solved was how to use flex blocks. It helped me solve the issues of moving my images and text around and moving all of them into tighter spaces, making them fit in those areas.
What did I learn?
I learned that li are not links. I thought that li were called links, but they are called "listed." I also learned more about headers, articles, sections, and divs.
What makes your project stand out?
My project stands out in the links. I made them so they change color when you hover them and when you hold down on them long enough. Some also have links that will send you in the right direction. I'm also happy that I got my background image looking the way it looks.

# Installation
What I did was open git labs, and I made a git clone of the challenges I had to do into a separate folder, which I then made into my Challenges folder. 
After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my portfolio, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there.
Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my index.html and style.css to use my project.
I used my git bash to add commit my work and pushed each time I made something new in my Portfolio.
I made the layouts of my portfolio on what it looks like in my html then I added images and text to the website as well. and then I used my style.css to make my text, padding, margins, colors, links, and background images.
